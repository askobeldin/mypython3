Ball screw
==========

A ball screw is a mechanical linear actuator that translates rotational motion
to linear motion with little friction. A threaded shaft provides a helical
raceway for ball bearings which act as a precision screw. As well as being able
to apply or withstand high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal
friction. They are made to close tolerances and are therefore suitable for use
in situations in which high precision is necessary. The ball assembly acts as
the nut while the threaded shaft is the screw. In contrast to conventional
leadscrews, ballscrews tend to be rather bulky, due to the need to have a
mechanism to re-circulate the balls.

Another form of linear actuator based on a rotating rod is the threadless
ballscrew, a.k.a. "rolling ring drive". In this design, three (or more)
rolling-ring bearings are arranged symmetrically in a housing surrounding a
smooth (thread-less) actuator rod or shaft. The bearings are set at an angle to
the rod, and this angle determines the direction and rate of linear motion per
revolution of the rod. An advantage of this design over the conventional
ballscrew or leadscrew is the practical elimination of backlash and loading
caused by preload nuts.
